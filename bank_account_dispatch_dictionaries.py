""" The dispatch function is a general method for implementing a message passing interface for abstract data. 
To implement message dispatch, we have thus far used conditional statements to compare the message string to a fixed 
set of known messages.

The built-in dictionary data type provides a general method for looking up a value for a key. Instead of using 
conditionals to implement dispatching, we can use dictionaries with string keys.

The mutable account data type below is implemented as a dictionary. It has a constructor account and selector
check_balance, as well as functions to deposit or withdraw funds. Moreover, the local state of the account is 
stored in the dictionary alongside the functions that implement its behavior."""

# By storing the balance in the dispatch dictionary rather than in the account frame directly, 
#Â we avoid the need for nonlocal statements in deposit and withdraw.

def account(initial_balance):
    def deposit(amount):
        dispatch['balance'] += amount

            return 'Insufficient funds'
